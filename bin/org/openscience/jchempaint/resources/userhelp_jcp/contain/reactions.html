<h3> Creating Reactions</h3>
<p>Due to the "chemically aware" nature of JChemPaint, for drawing a reaction 
you do not draw decorations like arrows etc., but draw the components and then 
declare them part of a reaction. So you first draw all reactants and products, 
best from left to right. Then right click on the first reactant, chose "Reaction
->Make Reactant in new reaction". Right click on any other reactant and chose 
"Reaction->Make Reactant in existing reaction". Right click on any product 
and chose "Product->Make Product in existing reaction". The reaction will then 
be rendered with + and arrows as appropriate. If you want to layout structures 
cleanly, just do "Tools->Clean Up" - this will layout molecules straight from 
left to right.</p>
<p>You can have multiple reactions in one drawing, for this choose "Reaction->
Make Reactant/Product in New Reaction" once you drew your first reaction. If you 
then do "Reaction->Make Reactant/Product in Existing Reaction", you are asked to 
which reaction you want to add.</p>
