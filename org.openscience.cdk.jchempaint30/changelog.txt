3.0.1
-----
New features:
* Interaction with tables and spectrum applet (see hightlightTable and spectrumRenderer applet parameters)

Fixes:
* Tooltips parameter in applet works
* (Virtually) Complete tranlations for Polish, Hungarian, Spanish, Czech
* Cancel in Enter Element dialog created empty elements
* All properties in the preferences dialog are stored in file system
* Undo/Redo buttons active after drawing a ring (trac #58)
* Phenyl rings no longer aromatic. Since aromaticity was not considered anywhere else, this lead to wrong H counts (trac #60)
* Large menus (transition metals only right now) are now two columns to fit on screen (trac #47)
* Certain functions (cleanup, open/save cml) failed in the applet due to problems with shrinking
